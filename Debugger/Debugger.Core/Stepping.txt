== Notes ==
- During evaluation some chains may be temporarly removed
- When two events are invoked and JMC is active, step out skips the second function
- Step out and step over works properly for exceptions
- Evaluation kills stepper overs on active frame
- StepRange callbacks go first (probably in order), StepOut callback are called after that
- StepRange is much slower then StepOut
